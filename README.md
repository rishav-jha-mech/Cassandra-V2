# Cassandra - Youtube Downloader Website

### Made using Django, Pytube, Bootstrap, AOS.

### [Cassandra V3](https://cassandra-v3.herokuapp.com/)

This project did not require a Database, and was started by me when i was just learning Django. So i decided to make this projecvt in a proper way by using Flask. Cassandra V1, V2 & V3 used Django as their Backend there have been a lot of improvement in the code since V1, but this will remain the last version(V3) of Cassandra (made using Django).

**From Version V4 i will be using Flask which is optimal for this project.**

After compressing files on Heroku the size of V3 was around 61 MB & the size of V4 was aroundd 53 MB.
Both V3 & V4 performed equally well in Google Lighthouse test except V3[Django] was a point or two faster than V4[Flask]
#### V3 [Django] -  Mobile - 81-84 Laptop - 97
#### V4 [Flask] -  Mobile - 79-80 Laptop - 97
