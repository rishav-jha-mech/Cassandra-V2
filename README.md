# Cassandra - Youtube Downloader Website

# [WEBSITE LINK](https://rj-cassandra-v2.herokuapp.com/)

## it kind of like breaks after 10 days of deployment so when you put the youtube url you wil see error 500 page
## after using my excellent debugging skills i found out that the problem is with heroku not with my code as it runs nicely on development environment

## if i check back my website again on heroku or re deploy it making no changes the website starts working fine. 

## Update 28-07-2021 actually the problem was with Pytube library which i was using, apparently Youtube changes itself from time to time to avoid Open Source Libraries Like this so until Pytube isnt updated this website wont work ğŸ˜ªğŸ˜ªğŸ˜ªğŸ˜ªğŸ˜ªğŸ˜ªğŸ˜ª
